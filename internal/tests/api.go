// Package tests implements a test suite for the Conduit server API.
//
// To use this package, your server must provide a NewServer function
// which returns a struct that satisfies the Server interface.
//
// You must also arrange for your server's test file to call the suite
// functions directly. Those are the functions that have the NewServer
// as a parameter.
